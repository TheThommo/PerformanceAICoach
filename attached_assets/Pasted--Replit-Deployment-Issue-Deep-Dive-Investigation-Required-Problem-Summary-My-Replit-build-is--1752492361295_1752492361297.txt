# Replit Deployment Issue - Deep Dive Investigation Required

## Problem Summary
My Replit build is consistently showing a blank site when accessed through the Replit app URL. This is preventing me from proceeding to domain deployment. **This is attempt #15** - I need a comprehensive diagnosis and permanent fix, not another surface-level suggestion.

## Current Symptoms
- ✅ Build appears to complete successfully
- ❌ Replit app URL shows completely blank page
- ❌ Cannot proceed to custom domain deployment
- ❌ Issue persists across multiple rebuild attempts

## Required Investigation Steps

### 1. Build Process Analysis
- Check build logs for ANY warnings or errors (not just failures)
- Verify all dependencies are correctly installed
- Confirm build output directory is correctly configured
- Validate that the build process is generating actual files

### 2. Server Configuration Review
- Verify the correct port is being used (typically 3000 for Replit)
- Check if the application is properly binding to 0.0.0.0 (not just localhost)
- Confirm the start command is correctly configured
- Validate environment variables are properly set

### 3. File System Investigation
- List contents of build/dist directory after build completion
- Check file permissions on generated files
- Verify index.html exists and is not empty
- Confirm all static assets are properly linked

### 4. Network/Routing Analysis
- Test if the application responds to health checks
- Verify routing configuration (especially for SPAs)
- Check if there are any CORS issues
- Validate that the app serves content on the root path

### 5. Browser/Client Side Check
- Inspect browser console for JavaScript errors
- Check Network tab for failed requests
- Verify if HTML is being served but appears blank
- Test in multiple browsers/incognito mode

## What I DON'T Need
- Generic "try rebuilding" suggestions
- Basic troubleshooting steps I've likely already tried
- Surface-level fixes that don't address root cause

## What I DO Need
- Systematic diagnosis of the actual problem
- Step-by-step investigation process
- Root cause identification
- Permanent solution with explanation
- Prevention steps for future deployments

## Success Criteria
- Replit app URL shows the actual website content
- Understanding of why this happened
- Confidence that the fix will work for domain deployment
- Clear steps to prevent this issue recurring

**Please provide a detailed action plan with specific commands to run and logs to check. I'm willing to share any logs, screenshots, or configuration files needed for proper diagnosis.**
