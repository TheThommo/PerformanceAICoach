# CRITICAL: App Instance Termination Causing Deployment Failure

## Root Cause Identified
My deployment logs show **app instances being terminated and restarted**, which is causing the blank page issue. This is a **Replit infrastructure stability problem**.

## Evidence from Logs
```

## Problem Analysis
1. **Instance ID Changes**: 984fbede → 272d3f5f → 245fb840
2. **Termination Signal**: "system: received signal terminated"
3. **Multiple Restarts**: App keeps getting killed and restarted
4. **Timing**: App starts successfully but gets terminated randomly

## Critical Questions for Replit Infrastructure Team

### 1. Why is my app being terminated?
- What triggers the "received signal terminated"?
- Is there a memory limit being exceeded?
- Are there CPU usage limits causing termination?
- Is this related to the MemoryStore warning?

### 2. Instance Management Issues
- Why are multiple instances running simultaneously?
- Are there conflicts between instance IDs?
- Is the load balancer routing to terminated instances?

### 3. Deployment URL Routing
- Is the deployment URL cached to a terminated instance?
- Does the deployment URL update when instances restart?
- Are there race conditions in the proxy routing?

## Immediate Investigation Needed

### Resource Usage Check
```bash
# Check memory usage during startup
free -h
ps aux | grep node

# Check if app is hitting resource limits
top -p $(pgrep node)
```

### MemoryStore Issue
The warning about MemoryStore might be related:
```
Warning: connect.session() MemoryStore is not designed for a production environment, as it will leak memory, and will not scale past a single process.
```

**Could this memory leak be causing the terminations?**

### Instance Stability Test
- Monitor how long instances stay alive
- Check if termination happens at specific intervals
- Verify if termination correlates with deployment URL access
