# CRITICAL: Replit Deployment Link Broken - Preview Works Fine

## Problem Summary
**This is NOT a code issue.** My Express.js application works perfectly in the Replit preview pane but the deployment URL serves a blank page. This indicates a Replit deployment configuration or infrastructure problem.

## Current Status
- ✅ **Preview pane works perfectly** - app displays correctly
- ✅ Server starts without errors on port 5000
- ✅ All routes and static files serve correctly in preview
- ✅ Express logs show normal operation
- ❌ **Deployment URL shows blank page: https://performance-ai-coach-markesthompson.replit.app/**
- ❌ **16 failed deployment attempts**

## Key Evidence
**The fact that preview works but deployment doesn't proves this is a Replit platform issue, not my application code.**

## Required Investigation by Replit Team

### 1. Deployment URL Routing Issue
- Is the deployment URL correctly forwarding to my running application?
- Are there any proxy/gateway issues between the deployment domain and my app?
- Check if deployment URL is hitting the correct port (5000)

### 2. DNS/Domain Configuration
- Verify DNS resolution for performance-ai-coach-markesthompson.replit.app
- Check if the deployment subdomain is properly configured
- Investigate any CDN/edge server issues

### 3. Replit Infrastructure Check
- Are there any known issues with deployment URL generation?
- Check deployment proxy configuration for my project
- Verify SSL/TLS termination is working correctly

### 4. Port Forwarding Verification
```bash
# Please verify these are identical:
# Preview URL port forwarding vs Deployment URL port forwarding
# Both should route to localhost:5000
```

### 5. Deployment vs Preview Differences
- What's different between how preview URLs and deployment URLs work?
- Are there different proxy configurations?
- Different caching or CDN behavior?

## Specific Tests Needed

1. **Direct curl test of deployment URL**:
   ```bash
   curl -v https://performance-ai-coach-markesthompson.replit.app/
   ```

2. **Compare headers between preview and deployment**:
   - Preview URL headers vs deployment URL headers
   - Response codes and content-type headers

3. **Check deployment logs vs runtime logs**:
   - Are deployment URLs hitting
